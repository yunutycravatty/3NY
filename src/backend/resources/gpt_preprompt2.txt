Deadline until when? (if we have more time, we can get better prices)

Long or short handles?

Employee:
A lot of questions. I don't have an appointment yet, but I think I‚Äùll have on soon. No idea what to put on it yet either. Probably just the logo, like in the example. In any case, multicolored and with long handles, as is currently IN.
The quality should be good - very good. Maybe you can request samples in advance or maybe you also have samples.
Please also offer Fairtrade.
